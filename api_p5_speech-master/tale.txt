Boy oh howdy i sure do love my graphs.
They are abselutely amazeballs, i would say.
they go up, they go down, and they're exponential, 
straigt and go all the way around.
well not the last one but its worth a try.
i love them, i sure do. They convey data like 
no other, its true.
Datamanipulation is also fun to do, 
and for that they are uncontested too.

now my presentation is coming to an an end, 
and yay becouse then i can go back again, 
play hearthstone idle games and maybe a moba too i'm done and finished woohoo
